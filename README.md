Solutions to problems from https://projecteuler.net/

I had previously done the first 7 problems of Project Euler using a mix of Python, C++, and Java. Unfortunately, I did not think to save those solutions.


## Sorry, not sorry. Please don't hate me.
Most of my solutions will likely be brute force attempts.

Currently, I am using Project Euler to familiarize myself with languages that are new to me, or that I may have forgotten. As such, I'm more concerned with utilizing the basics of a language than implementing the obscure mathematic shortcuts that Project Euler seems to be looking for.

Given time, I'll probably return to previous problems and try to optimize my code.
