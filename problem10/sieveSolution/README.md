This attempt at [Problem 10](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10) was done while I was waiting for the brute force attempt to run.

Here, I used [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to calculate all prime numbers between 0 and 2 million. This method is way more efficient and is clearly the superior method.
