This attempt at [Problem 10](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10) was pure brute force. I knew it was a bad idea, but I figured it'd take so long that I could make a better version while this one was still running.

The end result was a program that takes over an hour to run. I finished a smart solution to Problem 10 before the brute force program even made it past 1,000,000. But hey, it works.
